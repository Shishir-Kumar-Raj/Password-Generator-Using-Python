# Password-Generator-Using-Python

This project is a straightforward password generator developed using Python. It enables users to generate secure, randomized passwords by specifying the desired count of letters, digits, and special characters. When the script runs, it asks for the number of characters from each category that should be included. It then randomly picks from a set of lowercase and uppercase alphabets, numeric digits, and symbols to form the base of the password. Once all characters are selected, they are shuffled to ensure the final password has no discernible pattern, improving its overall security.

The script leverages Pythonâ€™s built-in `random` module to perform both the character selection and the final shuffle. It is lightweight and easy to execute in any environment with Python 3 installed. To use it, simply run the program through a terminal or command-line interface, enter the requested inputs, and it will generate a password for you instantly.

This tool is useful for anyone needing secure passwords for accounts, systems, or online platforms. While it's a basic version, it provides a good foundation and can be expanded to include features like a graphical interface, password strength analysis, or secure storage options. The code is open for anyone to use and customize as needed.
